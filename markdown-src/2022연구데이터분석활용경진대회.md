<br>

## 1. Project Overview

### Objective
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="500" alt="overview" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103119868/229269086-98ab2bd0-46aa-4a77-be6b-9fe949ee0be0.png"></p>

#### 1. Sales forecast for small businesses in Seoul by type of industry
- Possible to detect the point of sharp decline in sales by type of industry early
#### 2. Contribute to proposals for customized support policies for industries expected to see a sharp decline in sales
- Check the relative sales change by type of type of industry through the sales risk index
- Select appropriate support targets and obtain objective support evidence

<br>

## 2. Key action

### Data collection and merging
- Define 12 categories (323 factors) that affect the number of confirmed cases and sales in Seoul
    - Vaccination rate, confirmed cases, public holidays/Chuseok holidays, day of the week information, distancing level, population movement, 100 economic statistics index, etc.
- Data collection for 12 categories: Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Data Portal, Seoul Open Data Square, Seoul Big Data Campus, etc.
- Creating learning data by merging 12 categories data by date
- Data from 1 January, 2018 to 30 June, 2022 (1,642 days)

### Data preprocessing and cleansing
- Numericalization (i.g, "Karaoke business limit after 22:00" ‚Üí Percentage of business limit time: 0.333)
- Calculation of change rate compared to the previous day

### Sales forecasting modeling by type of industry
- Selection of industries related to small businesses: 8 industries including karaoke and household goods
- LSTM model training: 2 years of data utilization, model learning record management, confirmation of superiority compared to other models (RF, XGB, etc.)
- The sales trend by industry during the forecast period is expressed as a risk index

### DataOn - Application (Software) registration

## 3. What I learned from the project

### Importance of data collection and cleaning
- I was able to understand the difficulty of researching and collecting data that are scattered in many places for one keyword.
- Since the forms of the collected data were different, I learned the importance of the data collection process by collecting them with a certain standard in a form that can be used for learning.
- It is important to use a model with good performance, but it was a project that greatly realized the need for refined data (quality of data) used for modeling.

### Synergy effect of team project
- It was a meaningful project that felt the importance of transparent communication as all the team members shared the entire content and considered various discussions and directions, and felt the effect of a team that could gain great synergy and cheer each other up.
