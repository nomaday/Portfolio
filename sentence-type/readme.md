## 1. Project Overview  
### Objective
- Sentence type classification AI model development  
    Receive the sentences as the input and create an AI classification model for `type`, `tense`, `polarity`, and `certainty` of the sentence  


### Data

- ID: Unique ID by sample sentence
- Sentence: One sentence per sample
- Type: Type of sentence (factual, inferential, interactive, predictive)
- Polarity: The polarity of the sentence (positive, negative, undecided)
- Tense: The tense of the sentence (past, present, future)
- Certainty: The certainty of the sentence (certain, uncertain)
- Label: Class for each sentence - type, polarity, tense, and certainty (a total of 72 types of classes exist)  
    e.g, Factual-Positive-Present-Certain

- While dealing with multi-label classification, survey the relevant reference paper for which model is appropriate for the weighted f1 score, which is the evaluation criteria for the competition
    - <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BigBird</a> model seemed to fit
- Try to several PLM application of Hugging Face (`monologg/kobigbird-bert-base`, `klue/roberta-large`, `tunib/electra-ko-base`)
    - Apply while adjusting various parameters such as KFold, batch size, max length, learning rate, etc.
- Team Notion management, creation and organization of experiment management template

## 3. What I learned from the project
- The effect of the ensemble is quite significant.
- Having many options does not necessarily improve performance.
- It would have been nice to try a little more various things during the two-week period.

## 4. Final Result
- 22<sup>nd</sup> / 333 teams (Top 7%)
